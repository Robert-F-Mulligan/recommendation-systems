# Recommendation Systems


## Introduction

This repo is designed to showcase several methodolgies in order to derive `similarity` based on several pre-defined criteria. We will be using a dataset from **Movielens**, which has charcteristics and data on over *40,000* movies. 

The recommendations will be based on either:

- Weighted rankings
- Content

We will be relying on `scikit-learn` to derive:
- Feature vectors
- Feature matrices
- `TF-IDF` (term frequency-inverse document frequency)
- Linear kernel
- Cosine similarity

We will be using the `pandas` library to accomplish:
- Data cleaning
- Data merging
- Feature extraction
